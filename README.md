# Musicology Application

This project would be an application for giving musicological exercises to the user.

It produces Sequences of Musical Symbols with gaps and the young musician must fill them correctly.

**Note!** The current implementation is a demo and uses OpenCV to make the visualisation of the exercise!

**Note!** Currently, the rules for the musical notes and the images are chosen randomly! 

**This is the base for the BACN END of the application with some visualisation features.**


# TODO list!
* Add the GUI
* Parametrise the exercise creation to create various sequence of different difficulties
* Contact my musician friend and take the real Rules and Notes
